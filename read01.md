# **The Coder's Computer**

we use the CLI as an extension to the GUI, it allows us to enter commands to control files in the OS.  
a shell is a part of the OS that defines how the terminal behaves, the most common type of shell is bash.  
"pwd" shows the current working directory, "ls" lists the files in the current working directory, "cd" allows us to navigate through the folders.  
everything in Linux is a file, Linux determines the file type by looking through its contents, Linux is case sensitive.

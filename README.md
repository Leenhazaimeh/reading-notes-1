### **Growth Mindset**

Growth mindset is believing that any skill can be developed and **it's not fixed based on intelligence or talent**, developing any skill requires going through hardships and obstacles with effort and perseverance in order to learn any new skill.

In the words of Albert Einstein:
> Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new
